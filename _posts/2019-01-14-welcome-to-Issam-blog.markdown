First of all, Thank you for stopping by.

# Who am I?

I am a Network Engineer with many years of experience in various networking technologies. I spent my time to help WISP/ISP worldwide and in my free time, 
always learning new things. 

#### I believe in the statement 

"It does not matter much what you are doing, it's much more important with who you are doing it."


# What is this site about?
Starting a blog and creating an online presence, to share many things on my to-do list. Finally  I decided to start doing it.
I want to use this site as a place to share my experiences, hoping someone will benefit from that.
